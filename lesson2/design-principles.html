                    <p>
                        The Digital Ocean home page shows great use of contrast. They not only chose a very bright blue that stands out against the white
                        background, but they also make great use of large, bold font faces for headers that highlight reasons to use their platform. The blue on
                        white immediately draws your eye, making for a very good contrast of each other. Then the slightly lighter gray paragraph text underneath
                        each bright blue header creates a good contrast between the bright bold blue and the gray by putting the emphasis on the blue while still
                        drawing your eye downward. This creates a nice hierarchy of font, size, weight, and color to lead you down the desired path of information
                        gathering.

                    <p>
                        The Stripe home page has always been a favorite of mine for good, clean design and excellent use of both white space and color. The way the
                        morphing background abstract animation blends into white is a nice introduction to the brand and their tagline. Under all the eye-catching
                        color is some very simple text and two buttons, followed by a few brands that are very well spaced out. There's lots of empty space in play
                        here and it creates a clean space and makes it obvious what the next steps are for any site visitor.

                    <h3>Medium</h3>

                    <p>
                        I think Medium exemplifies Hick's Law very well, especially on their mobile landing page. There's very little going on, but just enough to
                        get you headed in the right direction. With only two buttons and a very simple home page feed of popular content, this home page gets you
                        right into the content and focuses the call to action buttons on the mission of medium, get you to sign up and read articles. There's not
                        much text or fancy design going on here, which is perfect for what this space needs to accomplish.
